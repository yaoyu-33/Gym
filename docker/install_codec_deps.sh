# Install codec-bearing packages that are excluded from the NeMo-Gym container.
#
# Run this before using VLM or audio/video benchmarks inside the container:
#
#   bash docker/install_codec_deps.sh
#
# Safe to call multiple times — exits immediately if already installed.
# Versions are pinned to match the container's uv.lock. Update these pins
# manually when uv lock bumps them (e.g. after a vllm upgrade).
# --no-config bypasses the project's sys_platform=='never' overrides.
