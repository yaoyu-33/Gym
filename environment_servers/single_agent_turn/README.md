# Single-agent-turn environment server

This Environment Server runs one agent turn against one Resources Server.
It seeds both participant sessions, grants configured task-scoped tool access and any sandbox access returned by Resources to the agent, invokes `/v1/responses` once, verifies the response, and closes both sessions.

Use this server when one agent turn produces the response that Resources verifies.
Other interaction patterns should define their own task input, episode result, and Environment Server implementation.

Resources tool access is opt-in. Set `resources_tool_transports` on the Environment Server deployment to any combination of `direct_http` and `mcp`. Leave it empty when the agent should receive no Resources tools:

```yaml
environment_servers:
  single_agent_turn:
    resources_tool_transports:
      - direct_http
      - mcp
```

`direct_http` grants the Agent Server scoped HTTP access to the Resources Server. `mcp` requires the Resources seed response to provide HTTP MCP connection metadata. Selecting neither transport sends `tool_accesses=[]` when the agent session is seeded.

The server supports `num_workers > 1`. Episode state and cleanup remain local to the worker handling that request. `max_concurrent_episodes` and queue admission are also enforced independently by each worker, so the deployment-wide concurrency limit is approximately `num_workers * max_concurrent_episodes`.
