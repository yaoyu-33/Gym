# BixBench-Hypothesis (BBH)
BixBench-Hypothesis is a dataset proposed by Edison Scientific to measure LLM capabilities for testing hypotheses in bioinformatics contexts. Edison Scientific and NVIDIA have also collaborated to release BBH-Train, an RL training dataset meant to improve model capabilities on bioinformatics-related data analysis.

There are two methods to running BBH with NeMo-Gym: the remote approach and the bundled approach. The remote approach hosts the environment sandboxes as an external service that NeMo-Gym can communicate with, serving as a modular method for running train/inference jobs. The bundled approach colocates the environment sandboxes on the Gym/RL nodes, serving as an efficient and fully packaged method for running train/inference jobs.

## Remote Approach:
To run the remote approach, first launch the dataset server implemented in the [hypotest](https://github.com/EdisonScientific/hypotest) repository. Documentation on how to run the dataset server can be found [here](https://github.com/EdisonScientific/hypotest/blob/main/README.md).

Then, prepare your Gym data with the task_idx values of the problems you would like to train/evaluate on. An example dataset is provided for reference in [data/example.jsonl](data/example.jsonl).

Once the dataset server is running and is accessible at a specific URL, update your config based on [config_remote.yaml](config_remote.yaml) with the server URL and api key, and launch NeMo-Gym as follows:

```bash
gym env start \
    --environment aviary_bbh/config_remote \
    --model-type vllm_model
```

Then collect rollouts on your data as follows (updating the input file to your Gym data if needed):

```bash
gym eval run --no-serve \
    --agent bbh_aviary_agent \
    --input environments/aviary_bbh/data/example.jsonl \
    --output environments/aviary_bbh/data/example_bbh_rollouts.jsonl
```

To run training with NeMo-RL, set the following fields in your NeMo-RL container (where train_data.jsonl and validation_data.jsonl are set to your train/val Gym data respectively, and bbh_remote.yaml is updated with your dataset server URL/api-key):
```yaml
data:
  train_jsonl_fpath: 3rdparty/Gym-workspace/Gym/environments/aviary_bbh/data/train_data.jsonl
  validation_jsonl_fpath: 3rdparty/Gym-workspace/Gym/environments/aviary_bbh/data/validation_data.jsonl
  shuffle: False
  num_workers: 1

env:
  should_use_nemo_gym: true
  nemo_gym:  # This is passed into NeMo-Gym as the initial_global_config_dict
    is_trajectory_collection: false  # Set this to true to enable trajectory collection (no training). You may also want to increase `policy.generation.vllm_cfg.gpu_memory_utilization`
    config_paths:
    - responses_api_models/vllm_model/configs/vllm_model_for_training.yaml  # Required! And it must be *for_training
    - environments/aviary_bbh/config_remote.yaml
```

Note that task_idx values in your Gym data must align with the data in [hypotest](https://github.com/EdisonScientific/hypotest); this means that both your train and val set problem data must be provided to [hypotest](https://github.com/EdisonScientific/hypotest)'s dataset server.

## Bundled Approach:
To run the bundled approach, first update the config in [config_bundled.yaml](config_bundled.yaml) with your desired configuration. The config fields in `dataset` closely match the config fields in [hypotest](https://github.com/EdisonScientific/hypotest). You'll also have to set [container_sqsh_path], which will be a path to a .sqsh file built from the [hypotest](https://github.com/EdisonScientific/hypotest) Docker container using [enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot).

You will also need to add your BBH problem data to [data/](data/), and update `capsule_dir` and `work_dir` with paths to your BBH capsule data and working directory. Note that the working directory must be set to a directory accessible to all nodes if you are running with multi-node jobs, in order for the environment to properly parallelize sandboxes across all available nodes (e.g. the working dir could be made be available on a network-filesystem like lustre).

Once you have your environment properly configured, you'll need to make sure [enroot](https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot) is installed into your Gym environment. In order to do this, make sure to run the following snippet before bringing up NeMo-Gym:
```bash
cd /tmp &&
apt-get update &&
arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) &&
curl -fSsL -O https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot/releases/download/v4.1.1/enroot_4.1.1-1_\${arch}.deb &&
curl -fSsL -O https://github.com/NVIDIA/enroot/releases/download/v4.1.1/enroot+caps_4.1.1-1_\${arch}.deb &&
apt install -y ./*.deb &&
apt-get install -y squashfuse &&
cd /path/to/gym/directory
```
And then bring up NeMo-Gym:
```bash
gym env start \
    --environment aviary_bbh/config_bundled \
    --model-type vllm_model
```
```bash
gym eval run --no-serve \
    --agent bbh_aviary_agent \
    --input environments/aviary_bbh/data/example.jsonl \
    --output environments/aviary_bbh/data/example_bbh_rollouts.jsonl
```

If you are running training with NeMo-RL and NeMo-Gym, add the following modification to your `ray.sub` file in NeMo-RL to support adding a setup command:
```diff
