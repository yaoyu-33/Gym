"""Streaming Chat Completions-dialect support shared by every Gym model server.

Blackbox harnesses that speak the OpenAI Chat Completions API over SSE (e.g. the OpenClaw
agent PinchBench runs) send requests the strict ``NeMoGymChatCompletionCreateParamsNonStreaming``
model rejects: a ``stream: true`` flag (its ``stream`` field is typed ``Literal[False]``, since a
Gym model server calls its backend non-streaming and buffers the whole response) plus a
``stream_options`` block, which is only meaningful alongside ``stream: true``.

A Gym model server can still serve these clients by computing the complete Chat Completion with
its existing non-streaming backend call and re-emitting it as an SSE stream. This module provides:

- the request-side sanitizer that maps the streaming wire body onto the strict params shape
  (drops ``stream``/``stream_options``, remembers whether usage was requested);
- the response-side synthesizer that re-emits a complete ``NeMoGymChatCompletion`` as the
  ``chat.completion.chunk`` SSE sequence a streaming client expects, terminated by ``data: [DONE]``.

Only the SSE envelope is synthesized -- there is no true token-by-token streaming. The dispatch
sends keepalive comments while the backend computes, then emits the complete answer. Backend
failures after the stream starts become terminal SSE errors. External staging stores training
tokens separately; token ids and training logprobs are not carried in the ``chat.completion.chunk``
schema. A client that does not set ``stream_options.include_usage``
gets no usage chunk, so a model-call record reconstructed from this stream will lack token counts.
