"""Shared failure names and episode execution stages.

Gym describes failures with free text and component-local labels, so the same failure
arrives at a collector, a log line and a metric under three different names and cannot be
grouped. This module holds the one vocabulary those producers share.

A name says *what kind of thing went wrong* and nothing else. Whether to retry, whether
the request may be replayed, whether a completed result should be masked, and what to tell
a person are all properties of the occurrence, not of the name — they live on the failure
record, on the verify response, and in ``failure_reason`` respectively. Keeping them out is
deliberate: metadata attached to a name goes stale the moment one caller wants to retry
what another caller does not.

Names are low cardinality on purpose. They are safe as a metric label or a span dimension;
``failure_reason`` never is, because it carries occurrence detail and can be unbounded.

This module imports only the standard library so that data tooling can read the vocabulary
without installing any server's requirements.
