        Shared by every executor because the ordering and the failure handling
        are policy rather than transport. The machine-local index goes first
        precisely because it cannot fail the submit, so if the manifest write
        does fail there is still a parseable record for the by-hand recovery the
        error asks for.

        The resolved config is written here, not by each executor's staging
        step, so that every executor -- today Slurm, tomorrow k8s or a local
        runner -- gets it for free from the one place all of them already call.

        Only the files' transport differs per executor, so it arrives as
        `write_manifest` -- `Connection.write_text` already has this signature --
        rather than this class owning a connection it cannot know how to open.
        Call it while that transport is still open: reopening one here would pay
        a second connection on every submit.

        The jobs are queued by the time this runs, so a failure has to name them
        or they are stranded with no record anywhere.
