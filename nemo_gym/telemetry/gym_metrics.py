"""Attributed OTel instruments that ``nemo.lens.instruments.gym.record_gym_metrics`` cannot express.

``nemo_gym.telemetry.metrics`` forwards to the five fixed, undimensioned instruments nemo-lens
declares. Anything that needs an attribute (a provider, a site, a class) is created here,
directly on the lens meter, and cached per meter so a re-initialised telemetry handle gets
fresh instruments. Every recorder is a no-op unless telemetry is initialised and exporting,
and never raises into its caller. Call sites use the relevant span-group or metrics-export gate
so disabled telemetry stays off the hot path.

Sandbox lifecycle
-----------------
``gym.sandbox.active`` (up-down counter): sandboxes this process currently holds, ``+1`` when a
provider hands back a handle, ``-1`` when Gym releases it. Summed by the backend across the
processes that hold sandboxes; a gauge would show whichever process wrote last.

``gym.sandbox.startup_duration_ms`` / ``gym.sandbox.exec_duration_ms`` (histograms): wall-clock
of one provisioning and one command. Explicit bucket boundaries up to thirty minutes: the SDK
default stops at ten seconds and a sandbox start routinely takes a minute.

``gym.sandbox.create_retry_total`` (counter): one per create attempt a provider retried.
Retrying is provider-internal, so each provider that retries records it from its own loop.

All four carry ``nemo.gym.sandbox.provider``.

HTTP connection pool
--------------------
``gym.http.connection_pool.queue_duration_ms`` (histogram): connection-acquisition wait
for one queued connection acquisition, combining repeated waiter wakeups within it.
Queued redirect hops, aiohttp reconnects, and Gym retries each record separate samples.
Connection attempts that acquire a slot immediately do not record a queue-duration histogram sample.
Bounded attributes identify the binding connector limit, queue outcome, and destination server.

``gym.http.connection_pool.connect_total`` (observable counter): all connection attempts
(``connect()`` calls), including attempts that later fail or are abandoned.
Compare its value with the queue-duration histogram count to calculate the queued fraction.
