"""NeMo Gym span groups, declared into nemo-lens's ``SpanRegistry``.

A span group is checked at every instrumentation site before any work happens, so a
disabled group costs one frozenset membership test. nemo-lens ships no group names of its
own: a consuming library registers the groups it emits under its own namespace, and users
select from them with the ``span_groups`` spec. Importing this module registers Gym's groups
and presets, so it must be imported before ``setup_telemetry``; ``init_telemetry`` does that.

``GymSpanGroup`` is a bag of ``str`` constants rather than a lens subclass, because
``managed_span`` and ``is_span_group_enabled`` take the group as a plain string. Call sites
keep reading ``GymSpanGroup.SANDBOX`` so the spelling lives in one place, and the constants
stay importable without nemo-lens: the *gate* is conditional, not the name.

Presets
-------
``default``
    ``job`` plus the cross-process spine (``server``, ``http_client``, ``rollout``). This
    is deliberately enough on its own to produce **one trace per rollout spanning the
    agent, model, and resources server processes** — the whole point of the integration
    works without tuning.
``per_rollout``
    The spine plus per-request detail (``verify``, ``agent``, ``model_call``). Omits
    ``job`` so each rollout is its own bounded root trace rather than nesting every
    rollout under one run-long span — the same reasoning behind NeMo-RL's ``per_step``.
``all``
    Reserved by nemo-lens: every group registered in the process, including ``sandbox``.

Registration is process-global, and presets **union** across namespaces. When Gym runs
inside a NeMo-RL process, ``default`` selects NeMo-RL's default groups *and* Gym's, and the
``job`` and ``rollout`` names are shared with NeMo-RL's groups of the same name.

There is deliberately no ``tool_call`` or ``dataset`` group. A resources-server tool call
is already a SERVER span named after its route (``POST /get_weather``), which answers the
same questions without a second layer; and Gym's dataset code is CLI upload/download
helpers, not a runtime path worth tracing. A span group with no call site is a knob that
silently does nothing, so neither is declared until something emits under it.

Disabling ``server`` or ``http_client`` breaks cross-process trace joining: ``server``
is the FastAPI ingress side that adopts an inbound ``traceparent`` as its parent, and
``http_client`` is the egress side that emits one. They are in every preset for that
reason.
