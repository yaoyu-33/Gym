"""Build trainable trajectories from a frozen token capture.

The consumer freezes a ``TokenCaptureSnapshot`` before passing its ``TokenEntry`` records here.
The builder can return multiple trajectories when a rollout contains independent call chains.

Each current record states whether the call starts a root, continues a verified parent, or has unresolved ancestry.
The builder verifies every resolved parent against the child's prompt tokens before joining the calls.
An unresolved call begins a separate fragment.
The builder never infers a parent across that boundary.

``prefix_merging`` uses token-prefix matching only when a verified parent is absent from the frozen snapshot.
For example, capture can filter a parent that generated no tokens.
In that case, prefix matching may reconnect the child to a verified surviving ancestor.

The build does not depend on capture order.
``prefix_merging`` processes entries by increasing prompt length because a parent's prompt is shorter than its child's.

Loss masks follow token provenance.
Policy-generated tokens have a mask value of 1 and retain their captured log probabilities.
Prompt tokens have a mask value of 0.
