"""Build trainable trajectories from a frozen token capture.

The builder consumes ``TokenEntry`` records from a ``TokenCaptureSnapshot``.
The snapshot is frozen before the consumer passes its entries to the builder.

``per_request`` creates one training sequence per call.
It does not infer relationships between calls.
It can return multiple trajectories.

``prefix_merging`` chains calls by token-prefix relationships.
Each call uses the earlier call with the longest matching cumulative sequence as its parent.
The cumulative sequence contains the prompt and generation.
This strategy rebuilds an append-only rollout as one chain.
A rewritten or compacted prompt starts a new root.
Identical candidate parents are ambiguous.
The builder quarantines the ambiguous subtree.

Both strategies are independent of capture order.
``prefix_merging`` processes entries by increasing prompt length.
This order comes from the tokens.
A parent's prompt is shorter than its child's prompt.

Loss masks follow token provenance.
Policy-generated tokens have a mask value of 1 and retain their captured log probabilities.
Prompt tokens have a mask value of 0.
