"""Define run-wide training-token capture settings.

```yaml
env:
  nemo_gym:
    token_id_capture:
      enabled: true
      dir: /tmp/ng_tokcap                  # The writer and consumer share this node-local directory.
      sink: my_pkg.sinks:MyDataPlaneSink   # This optional sink replaces the file store.

my_agent:
  responses_api_agents:
    custom_agent:
      token_id_capture: true
      token_id_capture_non_generating_requests:
        - method: GET
          path: /custom/metadata
```

Evaluation capture uses ``/ng-rollout/<id>/...``.
Training capture uses ``/ng-rollout/<id>/training-token-capture/...``.
Training capture records token ids and log probabilities.
Evaluation capture records request and response summaries.
A run can enable either path independently.
Training capture applies through the static agent flag or run-level ``all_agents``.
Native agents normally leave the static flag disabled.
Their responses already carry token ids.
The top-level ``model_call_capture_dir`` is the fallback file-store directory.

Choosing where records go
-------------------------
``sink`` names a class implementing ``TokenSink``, as ``module.path:ClassName``.
Each server process constructs its sink at app startup.
A framework must make that class importable in the server process.
A configured sink replaces the file store.
Consumers construct and inject their ``TokenSource`` in their own process.
Consumers call ``TokenSource.freeze`` to obtain an atomic snapshot.
Consumers retire that exact snapshot with its ``snapshot_id`` and version.
There is no HTTP token reader.
Uvicorn workers use spawned processes.
They do not inherit a sink installed by a launcher.
Configure the sink here so each worker builds its own.
Programmatic installation must occur inside the serving process.

Choosing who reads them back
----------------------------
``rebuild_response`` controls whether Gym rebuilds a finished rollout.
Gym freezes captured records before rebuilding ``response.output``.
Rebuilding does not retire the frozen snapshot.
Gym retires a successful build only after durable handoff.
Retirement uses the frozen ``snapshot_id`` and version.
Failed or masked builds retain their capture evidence.
Set it to false when a framework reads through its own ``TokenSource``.
Gym then stops after the write.
Read ownership is independent of write ownership.
