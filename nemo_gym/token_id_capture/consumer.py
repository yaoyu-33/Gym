"""Turn a rollout's frozen token capture into trajectories.

Gym rollout collection and trainer finalization use this consumer.
Gym reads a frozen snapshot from the local token store.
A trainer freezes the ``TokenSource`` provided by its transport.
Both paths pass snapshot entries through the same build and projection.

This module does not import rollout-record or model-server modules.
The caller supplies the ``rollout_id``.
Gym derives that ID from task, rollout, and attempt indices.
The result includes metrics that describe the build.
