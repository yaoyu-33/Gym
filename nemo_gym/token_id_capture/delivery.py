"""Build a token-bearing record from one finished rollout.

The finalizer freezes the rollout's captured model calls.
It rebuilds ``response.output`` from that frozen snapshot.
It does not retire the snapshot.
The caller may retire it only after durable handoff.
Retirement uses the frozen ``snapshot_id`` and version.

The caller provides both the rollout record and its ``TokenSource``.
Gym resolves its source from Gym configuration.
A training framework may provide a source from its own data plane.
Training correlation must preserve ``/ng-rollout/<id>/training-token-capture``.

Existing token ids are the policy's sampled data.
The finalizer leaves a rollout containing any token ids unchanged.
Failed or masked builds retain their capture evidence.
