"""Define interfaces for captured training tokens.

Gym owns the record shape and capture protocols.
A training framework may implement the transport.
The sink may run in a Gym model server.
It may instead run in a framework inference worker.
Engine-side placement keeps token arrays off Gym's HTTP response.
Consumers read through ``TokenSource.freeze``.
They identify the frozen state with ``snapshot_id``.
This module avoids FastAPI, Ray, Torch, and aiohttp imports.
