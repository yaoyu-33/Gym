"""Capture training tokens from one complete model response.

Streaming responses omit token ids from the wire.
The model server still holds the complete response before streaming.
Middleware provides a request-scoped token sink.
The model server passes its complete response to ``capture_tokens``.
The sink writes a ``TokenEntry``.
Its ``model_call_id`` joins the corresponding evaluation record.
