"""Attribute a finished rollout's verified terminal model call.

Every agent's ``/run`` result carries ``response``: the object the verifier
scored. Capture, by contrast, records every call the model server served,
including auxiliary calls, abandoned retries, and sub-agent branches. Terminal
attribution joins the verified response to exactly one captured call, so the
builder can deliver the chain that earned the reward instead of guessing among
chains or masking a healthy rollout.

The join is **independent witnesses with corroboration**, not a trust
hierarchy. The fact "which call was kept" is emitted in different places by
different agent classes, so up to four witnesses testify:

  explicit     — the caller names the kept call directly (a gate seal or an
                 agent-declared terminal id). Soft: a miss is an abstention
                 and other witnesses may still attribute.
  declared     — the harness reports the response id it retained. Selection
                 stops if that id does not match exactly one captured row.
  response_id  — the ``/run`` response's ``id`` equals the served id recorded
                 on exactly one entry. Possession of the id proves which
                 response the client actually received.
  content      — the fingerprint of the response's model-authored items
                 matches one entry. Three readings are pooled: the entry's
                 cumulative ``continuation_fingerprint`` when a lineage-aware
                 writer recorded one (a full-transcript response), the
                 fingerprint of the entry's own output (a final-turn-only
                 response), and the transcript's trailing model-authored
                 block (a merged multi-turn transcript).

External staging rows omit token arrays because those tokens remain in framework storage.
They carry a ``staging_key`` and precomputed content fingerprints instead.
This module identifies external staging rows by the presence of ``staging_key``.

Each witness abstains rather than guesses (ambiguity inside a witness is an
abstention, not a vote). The verdict then follows the stack's rule that claims
are verified, never ranked: witnesses that agree — or that name calls with
identical full token sequences — attribute; witnesses that contradict each
other attribute nothing and persist the disagreement, because a contradiction
is evidence of a real defect (a stale seal mapping, backend id reuse, a
transcript-synthesis bug) that outranking would silently bury. If no terminal
response ID is declared, a rollout with no witness or with disagreeing witnesses
falls back to the builder's strict single-chain policy. If a declared terminal
response ID cannot be attributed, the consumer masks the rollout instead.

The content witness deliberately uses ``assistant_fingerprint`` alone, without
a request-context digest. Attribution selects a chain whose tokens the builder
verifies independently; it never reuses tokens across the matched boundary.
Requiring context verification would spuriously refuse synthesized transcripts
that reformat tool output, without adding safety.
