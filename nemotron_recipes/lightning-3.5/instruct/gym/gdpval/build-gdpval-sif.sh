# Builds the Apptainer sandbox GDPval runs deliverables in — once, before
# gdpval.sh. Needs apptainer on the host; the definition ships with Gym, so run
# this from the Gym repo root (or set GYM_ROOT).
#
#   nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/gdpval/build-gdpval-sif.sh               # writes ./gdpval.sif
#   nemotron_recipes/lightning-3.5/instruct/gym/gdpval/build-gdpval-sif.sh /abs/out.sif  # writes somewhere else
#
# Then export the path gdpval.sh reads:
#   export GDPVAL_CONTAINER_PATH=/abs/out.sif
#
# Note: building inside Docker needs --privileged --device /dev/fuse, a subuid
# mapping for the build user (echo "root:100000:65536" >> /etc/subuid, same for
# /etc/subgid), and an output path on a container-local dir rather than a host
# bind-mount. On a Linux host, VM or cluster node it runs natively.
