# Example Multi-Turn Env

Reference example for multi-turn environments using Gymnasium API standard. 

`reset()` runs once at the start of an episode to initialize state and return an initial observation, which in the current implementation would be appended to any input messages in the dataset. `step()` runs after each model response and returns `(observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`. If `observation` is non-None, the agent appends it as a user message and calls the model again. When `terminated` is True or max steps is reached the episode ends.

This example replays scripted follow-up questions from `verifier_metadata`, then checks the final answer. Each `step()` either returns the next follow-up (reward 0, not done) or checks whether `expected_answer` appears in the final response and terminates. In the example data, getting the final answer correct requires answering all intermediate questions correctly.

`verifier_metadata` fields:
- `follow_ups` - list of follow-up messages sent after each model turn
- `expected_answer` - substring expected in the final model response

Example data provided in `data/example.jsonl`.

## Run

```bash
gym env start \
    --resources-server example_multi_turn_gymnasium \
    --model-type vllm_model
```

## Collect rollouts

```bash
gym eval run --no-serve \
    --agent example_multi_turn_gymnasium_agent \
    --input resources_servers/example_multi_turn_gymnasium/data/example.jsonl \
    --output results/example_multi_turn_rollouts.jsonl
```
