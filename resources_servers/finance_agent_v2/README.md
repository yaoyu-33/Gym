# Finance Agent v2 (FABv2) Resource Server

A NeMo Gym integration of the official [Vals Finance Agent Benchmark v2](https://github.com/vals-ai/finance-agent-v2)
that **reuses Vals's own tool code directly** (tools-only wrap) instead of
reimplementing it. The upstream `finance_agent.tools.*` classes are imported and
exposed as HTTP endpoints; the shared `responses_api_agents/finance_agent` loop
drives them, configured to Vals's v2 harness policy in
`configs/finance_agent_v2.yaml`. The public release ships no grader, so scoring is
our own per-criterion rubric judge — see [Verification](#verification).

`tests/test_upstream_parity.py` checks that configured policy against the
installed upstream package, so a pin bump that changes the harness fails here.

## Tools (imported from `finance_agent.tools`)

| Tool | Description | Requires |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `web_search` | Tavily web search (`TavilyWebSearch`) | `tavily_api_key` |
| `edgar_search` | sec-api.io full-text EDGAR search (`EDGARSearch`), or a local index | `sec_api_key`, or `local_edgar_index_path` |
| `price_history` | Tiingo daily OHLC for equity/etf/crypto/fx (`PriceHistory`) | `pricing_data_api_key` |
| `parse_html_page` | Fetch + parse a page to text, store under a key (`ParseHtmlPage`) | — |
| `retrieve_information` | LLM over stored docs via `{{key}}` prompts (`RetrieveInformation`) | `retrieval_model_server` |
| `calculator` | Safe arithmetic via simpleeval (`Calculator`) | — |
| `submit_final_result` | Submit the final answer; ends the loop (`SubmitFinalResult`) | — |

`parse_html_page` and `retrieve_information` share a per-session data storage
(`state`) dict, scoped by the HTTP session cookie. `edgar_search` is the only
way to find filing URLs, so its source must be configured or the server fails at
startup. Any other tool whose required key or model is not configured is
registered as unavailable and its endpoint returns a clear error, so the agent
can route around it.

### Where SEC data comes from

`edgar_search_mode` (required) selects the source for `edgar_search`.

| `edgar_search_mode` | `edgar_search` | SEC `parse_html_page` | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local` | Local SQLite index | Cache, then the filing corpus, then sec.gov | `local_edgar_index_path`; `sec_dump_path` for corpus reads |
| `live` | sec-api.io | Cache, then sec.gov | `sec_api_key` |

The benchmark config sets `live`. Asking for `local` without an index fails at
startup. The
mode in use, and in local mode the date range the index covers, is logged at
startup; `NEMO_GYM_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` silences that.

Local mode subclasses the upstream tools rather than replacing them, so the
name, description and parameter schema the model sees are unchanged and a
sample written against the live benchmark runs either way. Only the fetch
differs. Corpus reads need the index to map a filing URL to its file, which is
why they are local-mode only. Parsed corpus text is written to the cache when
`use_cache` is on, so each filing is parsed once. `parse_html_page` still
resolves URLs the corpus does not hold, through the same cached fetch live mode
uses, and logs its reads by source
(`sec-corpus`, `cache`, `live`) so a corpus that is missing most of what is
asked for is visible rather than just slow.

A search whose date range falls outside the indexed span returns an error
naming that span, rather than the empty result that would send the model
looking for a better query. Live mode has no equivalent, since sec-api.io
serves the whole of EDGAR.

See [`resources_servers/sec_local_index/README.md`](../sec_local_index/README.md)
for the shared library behind both modes and how it is kept aligned with
upstream.

## Dependencies

Both upstream pins are exact so the benchmark stays reproducible:

```
-e nemo-gym[dev] @ ../../
model-library==0.1.25
finance-agent @ git+https://github.com/vals-ai/finance-agent-v2.git@<pinned-sha>
```

`model-library` declares `openai[aiohttp]>=2.28.0`, which cannot resolve against
the vllm-compatible `openai` that Gym pins. The upstream code runs fine on the
older client, so only the declared floor is the problem, and `overrides.txt` drops
it with `openai[aiohttp]<=2.7.2`. That line must mirror the cap in the root
`pyproject.toml`, because `uv --override` replaces *every* declared constraint on a
package, Gym's included; a test asserts the two stay in sync.

`finance-agent` publishes no tags and is not on PyPI, so it is pinned to a commit.
nemo-gym requires Python >=3.13.14, the binding floor here.

## Setup (`env.yaml`)

Run this environment with **two configs**: this environment config
(`configs/finance_agent_v2.yaml`) plus a model config
(`responses_api_models/openai_model/configs/openai_model.yaml`, or
`vllm_model.yaml` for a self-hosted endpoint).

Set endpoints and credential references in the repo-root, gitignored `env.yaml`.
`sec_api_key` is required when `edgar_search_mode` is `live`. The other tool keys
are optional at startup; missing keys make those tools unavailable. Live runs need policy/retrieval model access, and `/verify` needs judge-model access.

```yaml
# env.yaml
policy_base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
policy_api_key: ${oc.env:OPENAI_API_KEY}
policy_model_name: gpt-5-mini

# Judge model used by /verify. Kept separate from the policy on purpose, so that
# models evaluated on this benchmark are all graded by the same judge.
search_judge_model_base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
search_judge_model_api_key: ${oc.env:OPENAI_API_KEY}
search_judge_model_name: gpt-5-mini

# Required: live (sec-api.io) or local (see "Where SEC data comes from").
edgar_search_mode: live

sec_api_key: ${oc.env:SEC_API_KEY,null}                 # edgar_search (sec-api.io); required in live mode

# Optional for startup; both are needed for full-tool benchmark coverage.
tavily_api_key: ${oc.env:TAVILY_API_KEY,null}           # web_search (Tavily)
pricing_data_api_key: ${oc.env:TIINGO_API_KEY,null}     # price_history (Tiingo)

# Persistent, shared cache root (survives across jobs; served on cache hits):
finance_agent_v2_cache_dir: /shared/cache/finance_agent_v2
```

`${oc.env:VAR,null}` preserves optional-tool behavior when a variable is absent.
Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` for both model endpoints in this example; policy and judge
keys can be configured independently. For an authenticated judge endpoint,
replace the shipped `unset` placeholder with its credential.

Tool-key and cache settings resolve as config key → environment variable → default.
You can omit them from `env.yaml` and export `SEC_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`,
`TIINGO_API_KEY`, and `FINANCE_AGENT_V2_CACHE_DIR` instead. Explicit config values
take precedence. The `policy_*` keys have no default. Resolved configurations may
contain secrets; redact credentials before sharing or logging them.

Full-tool benchmark coverage requires all three service keys and network access
to the tools, fetched pages, and model endpoints. Record missing-tool limitations
with results. Grading also needs judge connectivity, including internet access
for the hosted endpoint above.

## Run

The public benchmark recipe (dataset + `prepare.py` + config) lives in
`benchmarks/finance_agent_v2/`; the server code and its `gym env test` fixtures
stay here. There is deliberately no `environments/finance_agent_v2/` entry:
training runs this same resources server on externally generated SDG data.

```bash
# Unit tests + example-data validation for this resources server
gym env test --resources-server finance_agent_v2

# Build the public 27Q benchmark JSONL (downloads the Vals CSV if absent)
gym eval prepare --benchmark finance_agent_v2

# End-to-end (prepare + start servers + collect rollouts) on the benchmark set
gym eval run --benchmark finance_agent_v2 \
  -c responses_api_models/openai_model/configs/openai_model.yaml
```

Add `--limit 3 --concurrency 3` for a smoke run. `gym eval run` writes the scored
rollouts plus `<output>_aggregate_metrics.json`.

Each prepared sample carries the upstream prompts and tool JSON schemas, read at
prepare time from `benchmarks/finance_agent_v2/upstream_spec.json` — a generated
snapshot, because `finance_agent` is installed in this server's venv only while
`gym eval prepare` runs in the repo-root venv. Bumping the pin means editing
`requirements.txt` and `_UPSTREAM_SHA` in `prepare.py` together, `uv sync`, then
regenerating the snapshot from this venv and re-running `gym eval prepare`:

```bash
cd resources_servers/finance_agent_v2 && source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/export_upstream_spec.py
```

`tests/test_upstream_spec.py` fails if the snapshot drifts from the installed
package, and `prepare.py` refuses to run when the two shas disagree.

## Caching

Tiingo and SEC calls are rate-limited and, within the pinned window, return
immutable data, so the server caches them to disk. Each `Cached*` class subclasses
the upstream tool, overrides only its network method, and stores the **raw upstream
response**, which untouched upstream code then re-serializes. A hit is therefore
byte-identical to a live call and survives an upstream formatting bump.

| Source | Cached unit |
|--------|-------------|
| `price_history` (Tiingo) | per-`(endpoint, ticker)` master of raw records, sliced on read by the upstream `_records_to_csv` |
| `edgar_search` (sec-api.io) | raw `filings` list keyed by the normalized request |
| `parse_html_page` on sec.gov filing URLs | parsed text at `sec_filings/<cik>/<accession>/<primary-doc>.txt`; general web is not cached |

Caching is on by default. Point `cache_dir` at a shared absolute path so it
survives across jobs:

```yaml
use_cache: true                            # true = read+write, false = off
cache_dir: /shared/cache/finance_agent_v2  # null -> ~/.cache/nemo_gym/finance_agent_v2
```

`cache_dir` also reads `FINANCE_AGENT_V2_CACHE_DIR`. Tiingo responses are cached
verbatim and never re-derived, and extending a window keeps already-cached rows, so
an adjusted price level cannot drift with the fetch date between re-runs.

To populate the cache ahead of an offline eval:

```bash
python resources_servers/finance_agent_v2/scripts/prefetch_prices.py \
  --cache-dir /shared/cache/finance_agent_v2 \
  --tickers AAPL MSFT NVDA --asset-class equity
```

## Verification

Each criterion in the dataset's `rubric` is judged separately against the answer
the agent passed to `submit_final_result`. Per criterion the judge returns a binary
verdict as JSON; calls repeat until `judge_required_successes` (default 3) replies
parse, capped at `judge_max_attempts` (default 10). Errors and unparseable replies
consume an attempt and are retried; only a reply that ran out of output budget
escalates that budget. The criterion's score is the majority of those verdicts, so
an odd count cannot tie.

Reward is **Partial Credit**: the severity-weighted pass fraction, forced to `0.0`
if any `must_pass` dealbreaker failed. Weights come from each criterion's
`modifiers` in the dataset and are applied after judging — the judge never sees
them, so a criterion cannot be graded more harshly for being expensive to fail.
Criteria without `modifiers` default to severity 1.0 and non-gating, so an
unweighted dataset scores as a plain pass fraction.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `reward` | Partial Credit — the weighted pass fraction, zeroed by any failed dealbreaker |
| `rubric_partial_credit` | the same number under Vals's name for it |
| `rubric_weighted_fraction` | Partial Credit *before* gating; the gap is what the dealbreakers cost |
| `rubric_all_pass` | `true` only when every criterion resolved and passed — Vals's All-Pass |
| `rubric_fraction` | criteria passed / total, unweighted |
| `rubric_dealbreakers_failed` / `rubric_dealbreakers_total` | how many `must_pass` criteria there were, and how many failed |
| `rubric_unresolved` | criteria that never got enough parsable verdicts |
| `rubric_judgements[]` | per-criterion votes, evidence, weights used, and sampled failed replies |
| `judge_error` | set when scoring could not complete — **filter these out rather than reading them as zeros** |

A criterion the judge never resolved is a judge failure, not a miss, so it scores
`null` rather than `0` and flags the row via `judge_error`. It still weighs as
not-passed, because treating an absent verdict as a pass would inflate exactly the
runs whose judging broke. A row with no rubric at all scores 0 with `judge_error`
set, so the agent and tools can be validated before labels exist.

The agent records why its loop ended in `response.metadata.stop_reason`
(`done_tool`, `max_turns`, `max_time`, `max_output_tokens`, `error`). Under
dealbreaker gating a truncated trajectory scores the same as a confidently wrong
one, so check this before reading a low score as a capability result.

Because both the judge model and its prompt are ours, scores are **not** comparable
to Vals's published numbers. The prompt lives in
`prompt_templates/finance_agent_v2_rubric_judge.yaml`.

`verify` is a pure function of the request body plus this server's config, so the
server declares `REVERIFY_MODE = STATELESS`: after changing the judge prompt or
parameters you can rescore stored rollouts without re-running the policy.

```bash
gym eval reverify --benchmark finance_agent_v2 --model-type openai_model \
  --inputs results/<run>_materialized_inputs.jsonl \
  --rollouts results/<run>.jsonl \
  --output results/<run>_rejudged.jsonl --concurrency 4
```

Select the **same** config the rollouts were collected with: reverify routes each
row by the agent name stored on it. `--model-type` is required either way, because
the `retrieval_model_server` reference must resolve even though reverify only calls
`/verify`.

**Dataset.** The `example.jsonl` fixtures here and the prepared benchmark JSONL
derive from the **public** Vals Finance Agent Benchmark v2 release; use is subject
to that project's terms. The public release ships no official grader.

**Grading is our own.** Vals's private grader was obtained under a separate license
and is **deliberately not reproduced** here; the judge prompt was written from
scratch, so scores are not directly comparable to Vals's published numbers.
