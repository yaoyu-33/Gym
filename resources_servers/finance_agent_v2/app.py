Finance Agent v2 (FABv2) Resource Server.

Tools-only reuse of Vals's finance-agent-v2: the upstream ``finance_agent.tools.*``
classes are imported (never reimplemented) and each is exposed as an HTTP endpoint.
The public release ships no official grader — Vals's is privately licensed and not
reproduced — so ``/verify`` uses our own: each ``rubric`` criterion is judged
separately and decided by majority vote.

Upstream tool surface (``finance_agent.tools``):
  - web_search (TavilyWebSearch)              — needs Tavily key
  - edgar_search (EDGARSearch)                — needs sec-api.io key
  - parse_html_page (ParseHtmlPage)           — writes to per-session storage
  - retrieve_information (RetrieveInformation) — LLM over stored docs
  - calculator (Calculator)                   — no key (simpleeval)
  - price_history (PriceHistory)              — needs Tiingo key
  - submit_final_result (SubmitFinalResult)

Tools implement ``async execute(args, state, logger)`` and share a per-session
``state`` dict, which this server scopes by HTTP session cookie.
