"""GDPVal resources server.

Scores agent deliverables for the GDPVal benchmark. Two modes,
selected via ``reward_mode`` config:

- ``rubric``: score deliverables against a per-task rubric using an LLM
  judge. Reward in [0.0, 1.0].
- ``comparison``: pairwise-judge the eval deliverable against a reference
  rollout's deliverable for the same ``task_id``. Reward in {0.0, 0.5, 1.0}.
  ``aggregate_metrics`` then reduces win/loss/tie counts into an ELO rating.

Scoring internals live in ``scoring.py`` (rubric) and ``comparison.py``
(pairwise judge + ELO math).

Both modes grade with a multi-judge *panel* (``judge_panel``): a set of frontier
judges (e.g. GPT-5.5, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview, Claude Opus 4.8, each at their own
reasoning settings) that are sampled per comparison/scoring call. Panel sampling
+ seeding lives in ``judge_panel.py``. A single judge is just the degenerate
one-member panel synthesized from ``judge_model_server`` when ``judge_panel`` is
unset — there is one panel-based code path either way.

        - **Audio** is best-effort: if no (routed) judge can read it — the common
          MiniMax-M3 case, which has no audio tower — the audio files are dropped
          downstream with a warning and the rest of the deliverable
          (video/images/text) is still graded. Never fatal.

        Returns ``(routed_judges, audio_capable, video_capable)`` where the
