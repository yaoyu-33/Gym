"""Multi-judge panel support shared by the GDPVal rubric and comparison scorers.

A *panel* is a set of LLM judges (each a distinct upstream model + reasoning
settings, e.g. GPT-5.5 medium, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview high, Claude Opus 4.8
high). For every individual scoring/comparison we *sample* one panel member —
the per-trial grader is drawn here. Sampling is seeded (via :func:`make_rng`)
so a rerun of the same task lands on the same judges and the result is
reproducible.

Tasks whose deliverables/references carry audio or video files are instead
*routed* per-modality to the judges that read that modality (audio and video are
tracked separately via :func:`dir_media_modalities` and each member's
``handles_audio`` / ``handles_video`` flags), since most judges can't read those
modalities natively — and some (e.g. MiniMax-M3) read video but not audio.

This module is intentionally connection-agnostic: a :class:`ResolvedJudge`
carries only the upstream coordinates (base URL / model / api key / create
overrides). The rubric scorers build an ``AsyncOpenAI`` client from these; the
comparison scorer wraps them in its own client-bearing ``Judge`` for the
threaded sync path.
