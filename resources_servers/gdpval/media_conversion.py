"""Media conversion for image-only multimodal judges (e.g. locally-served Kimi K2.6).

The frontier judges (Gemini / GPT / Claude) accept PDFs directly as an
``application/pdf`` data URL and rasterize server-side. Locally-served
vision-language judges (Kimi K2.6 on vLLM, Qwen-VL, InternVL, …) only accept
**image** inputs — they cannot decode a raw PDF data URL. For those judges we
must pre-render each PDF/Office page to a raster image (PNG) and, additionally,
extract the underlying text so the judge gets both the visual layout and a
clean textual copy it can quote from.

This module is the single home for that ``images_and_text`` conversion so the
two content-block builders — the pairwise comparison scorer
(:mod:`resources_servers.gdpval.comparison`) and the rubric visual scorer
(:mod:`responses_api_agents.stirrup_agent.file_reader`) — share one code path.

Everything here is pure-python: PDF rasterization uses PyMuPDF (``fitz``, already
a GDPVal dependency) so there is no poppler/system dependency, and text
extraction reuses ``pdfminer.six``.
