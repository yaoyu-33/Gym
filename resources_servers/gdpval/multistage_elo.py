"""Pure building blocks for multi-stage adaptive ELO estimation on GDPVal.

Instead of comparing the evaluated model against every reference model on all
tasks, multi-stage ELO runs a sequence of *stages*. Each stage:

1. Samples ``T`` tasks from a task-distribution JSON file (see
   ``responses_api_agents.stirrup_agent.task_distribution``); ``T`` is
   configurable per stage and **defaults to the full task set**,
2. Includes a set of ``M`` reference models and assigns **each task a single
   reference** from that set — an independent uniform draw by default, with an
   opt-in seeded balanced assignment — so a task is judged against one reference,
   not all ``M``,
3. Fits an anchored Bradley-Terry MLE ELO from that stage's win/loss/tie
   battles pooled per reference (reusing ``comparison.calculate_mle_elo``), and
4. Uses that estimate to choose the ``M`` references for the next stage.

Across stages, ``M`` typically shrinks (zooming in on references whose known
ELO is closest to the evaluated model's current estimate) while ``T`` grows (up
to the full task set) — spending the judge budget on a tighter final estimate.
Because each task's deliverable is reference-independent, a deliverable is
produced once and reused when its task recurs in a later stage — that stage only
re-judges it against its freshly assigned reference.

This module is intentionally **pure / server-agnostic** — reference selection,
per-task reference assignment, ELO fitting, vote pooling, and distribution
loading, with no server or rollout I/O. The orchestration that wires these into
Gym's standard rollout-collection flow (the single supported entry point) lives
in ``multistage_orchestrator`` and is enabled with ``++multistage.enabled=true``.

    ``min_success_fraction`` gates successful rollout coverage across the whole
    stage. ``min_per_reference_success_fraction`` and
    ``min_successful_rows_per_reference`` apply independently to every selected
    reference model, so an anchor cannot disappear entirely from a partial fit.
    ``waivable_failure_classes`` lists the persisted failure classes that may be
    newly waived; it defaults to task timeouts only. Rows already resolved by the standard terminal/max-attempt rules
    remain eligible, but every omission still counts against the configured
    coverage floors. Drained/no-persist and missing rows keep the stage open.

    ``tolerate_unresolved`` relaxes *only* the failure-class test: an unresolved
    row that came back with any persisted failure class is accepted, subject to
    the coverage floors. It never waives a row that never returned, that was
    drained/no-persist, or that carries no failure class at all -- their absence
    is the resume signal that lets the next allocation re-dispatch them intact,
    so those keep the stage open as they do without the flag. Set it on a
    calibration stage whose omissions are structural -- a missing reference
    deliverable does not appear on retry unless the reference tree is repaired,
    so holding the stage open for it only costs further launches until the row
    reaches ``NEMO_GYM_MAX_ROLLOUT_ATTEMPTS``.

    Enabling it accepts more than structural gaps: *every* persisted class
    becomes waivable, including the infrastructure-wide ones
    (``agent_request_failed``, ``agent_run_error``, ...). A whole agent-server
    outage mid-stage is therefore indistinguishable from scattered structural
    omissions, and the coverage floors above are the only remaining guard. Set
    them deliberately tight before turning this on.
