"""Run multi-stage adaptive ELO *through* the standard Gym rollout collection.

This is the single supported way to run multi-stage ELO. It drives the
**standard** rollout-collection machinery so a multi-stage run produces the exact
same artifacts a normal ``ng_e2e_collect_rollouts`` run does —
``evaluator_rollouts.jsonl`` plus ``<stem>_aggregate_metrics.json`` carrying
``comparison/eval_elo`` — which nemo-evaluator parses and exports to mlflow. That
makes multi-stage ELO a drop-in mode of the normal flow: enable it with
``++multistage.enabled=true`` (a plain full run is just a single-stage run).

How adaptivity maps onto the single-pass flow:

* Each stage is one pass of the standard rollout collection over the stage's
  sampled ``T`` tasks (``T`` is configurable per stage and defaults to the full
  task distribution). The stage includes a set of reference models (chosen
  adaptively — see below) and assigns **each task a single reference** from that
  set; the default is an independent uniform sample, while partial-completion
  stages use a seeded balanced assignment. The task's row is tagged with that
  one ``reference_ids=[ref]`` (honored by the GDPVal verifier's per-request
  reference filter) and a ``stage_index``.
* Between stages we fit the stage's anchored Bradley-Terry MLE ELO (the same
  math the server's ``aggregate_metrics`` uses) — pooling each reference's
  win/loss/tie counts over the tasks assigned to it — to pick the next stage's
  references — those whose known ELO is closest to the running estimate.
* A task's deliverable is reference-independent, so it is produced at most once:
  when a ``(task, repeat)`` recurs in a later stage its row is tagged
  ``reuse_cached_deliverable=True`` and the agent judges the cached deliverable
  against that stage's freshly-assigned reference instead of re-running the
  policy.
* After the last stage, all stages' rollouts are concatenated and handed to the
  standard ``_call_aggregate_metrics``; the GDPVal ``aggregate_metrics`` is
  stage-aware (it sees the ``stage_index`` tags) and reports the **last** stage's
  ELO as the headline ``comparison/eval_elo`` while exposing every stage's
  estimate as a ``comparison/stage_<k>/*`` extra.

The pure staging logic (task planning, reference selection, ELO fit) is reused
from ``multistage_elo``; this module only adds the wiring to the rollout
collection. The rollout-execution step is injected (``run_rollouts``) so the
orchestration is unit-testable without any servers.

    task set), select the included references (closest known ELO to the running
    estimate), assign each sampled task one reference, build the stage's rollout
    rows, execute them via ``run_rollouts``, tag the results, pool the
    per-reference votes, and fit the stage ELO (threaded into the next stage's
    selection). Fresh partial-completion stages balance assignments across the
    selected references; other fresh stages use independent uniform draws.
    ``all_result_rows`` is the concatenation of every stage's tagged results
    (ready to write as the standard rollouts file); ``stage_summaries`` is one
    dict per stage for logging.

    ``rng`` seeds task sampling (defaults to ``multistage_config.seed``); per-task
    reference assignment is seeded independently per stage via
    ``stage_assignment_rng``.

    When ``resume`` is provided the loop reuses persisted state: complete stages
    are not re-dispatched (their cached rows are re-fitted for ELO threading),
    interrupted stages re-dispatch only the ``(task, rollout)`` rows without a
    persisted success, and recorded plans (including each stage's per-task
    reference assignment) are replayed so selection is identical even when
    ``multistage.seed`` is ``None``. ``resume=None`` preserves the same execution
    semantics without file-backed persistence.
