"""GDPVal rubric scoring via LLM judge.

Separated from the task strategy so it can be tested / reused
independently.  Provides three scoring modes:

- ``score_with_rubric`` — text-based (sends extracted text to any LLM)
- ``score_with_rubric_visual`` — multimodal (sends PDF renders to Gemini)
- ``score_with_rubric_structured`` — structured scoring with tagged output
  format, multi-trial averaging, and formatting retries
