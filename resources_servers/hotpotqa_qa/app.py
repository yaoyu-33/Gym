# Resources server for short-answer question answering benchmarks like
# HotpotQA (closed-book and open-book). Verification is fully deterministic:
#   1. Extract a JSON-formatted answer from the model output (last valid JSON
#      object containing an "answer" key wins, matching the prompt).
#   2. Compute SQuAD-style answer EM and token-overlap F1 against the
#      ground-truth answer.
#   3. Compute alternative-aware substring match (lenient + strict) over
#      surface-form variants of the ground truth.
#   4. Mark unreliable ground truths (long answers / multi-word names) so
#      downstream aggregation can report both "all" and "filtered" metrics.
#
# All three scoring routines are faithful ports of Skills'
# `nemo_skills/evaluation/metrics/hotpotqa_metrics.py` and
# `nemo_skills/evaluation/metrics/hotpotqa_filtering.py`.
