# Interactive Browser — NeMo-Gym browser RL environment

A NeMo-Gym **stateful resources server** that turns a real browser into an RL
environment. Each rollout (`session_id`) owns one isolated live browser context;
the policy drives it with tool calls (navigate / click / type / observe / finish);
`verify()` returns the task reward from the live browser state.

This is the interactive complement to the existing read-only browsing envs
(`google_search`, `browsecomp_advanced_harness`): those search-and-extract text;
this one *operates* pages (stateful, multi-step web agency).

## Backends

The server depends only on the small `BrowserBackend` contract
(`browser/base.py`): `open / goto / click / type / observe / current_url / text /
close`. Where the browser actually runs is one config block; nothing else in the
environment changes.

| `backend:` | Browser runs | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `local_playwright` (**default**) | A Chromium launched on this machine, one per rollout | Local dev, CI, offline `site/` tasks. No account, no quota, no network. |
| `remote_cdp` | Anywhere reachable over CDP, supplied per rollout by a **session provider** | Keeping browsers off the training node: a browser container, another host, or a hosted browser service. |

```yaml
backend:
  local_playwright:
    headless: true
```

```yaml
backend:
  remote_cdp:
    connect_timeout_s: 60
    session_provider:
      static_cdp:
        cdp_url: "http://127.0.0.1:9222"    # e.g. chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

### Session providers

A provider answers one question for `remote_cdp`: *where is this rollout's
browser, and how do I give it back?*

```python
class BrowserSessionProvider(Protocol):
    name: str
    async def acquire(self, spec: BrowserSessionSpec) -> BrowserSessionHandle: ...   # returns a live cdp_url
    async def release(self, handle: BrowserSessionHandle) -> None: ...               # idempotent
```

| Provider | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `static_cdp` (built in) | Uses an endpoint that already exists (`cdp_url`, or `$BROWSER_CDP_URL`). Release is a no-op. |
| `lexmount` (example) | Creates one isolated cloud browser session per rollout and deletes it afterwards. Code, config and docs live together in [`providers/lexmount/`](providers/lexmount/README.md). |

Providers are selected by name (`{provider_name: {kwargs}}`) and imported only
when selected, so an unused provider never pulls in its SDK. Publish one from
your own package with an entry point — no fork required:

```toml
[project.entry-points."nemo_gym.browser_session_providers"]
my_browser_cloud = "my_pkg.provider:MyProvider"
```

`register_session_provider(name, cls)` does the same thing in-process, and
`register_backend(name, builder)` adds a backend that is not CDP-shaped at all
(a vendor SDK with its own DOM API implements `BrowserBackend` directly).

## Tools & observation

Tools: `browser_navigate(url)`, `browser_click(element_id)`,
`browser_type(element_id, text)`, `browser_observe()`, `browser_finish(answer)`.
Observation is a **compact numbered list of interactive elements** (`[id] role: name`)
plus URL/title — deliberately token-cheap (raw HTML/pixels are far too expensive for
small policies and for training context length). `element_id`s come from the most
recent observation.

Element collection stops at `max_elements` (default 50) — probing each interactive
node costs several browser round-trips, so a large page is truncated rather than
fully scanned, and the observation says so.

## Reward

`verify()` scores a per-task success spec in `verifier_metadata`:
`final_url` / `url_contains` / `dom_contains` / `answer_equals`. Sparse 0/1 outcome
reward by default (least reward-hackable); extend `_score()` with new keys as needed.

A spec carrying none of those keys **raises** rather than scoring 0 — a misspelled
key would otherwise give every rollout reward 0, which looks identical to a policy
that never solves the task.

## Session lifetime

A browser is released when the rollout is scored (`verify`), when the same
`session_id` is re-seeded, or when an Environment Server closes the session
through `/close_session`. An Environment Server assigns the session id and
registers that close before it seeds, so an episode that ends before `verify`
still gets its browser released, and a seed that arrives after its close opens
nothing (`tests/test_resources_sessions.py`). The server keeps browsers in
process, so it requires `num_workers: 1`.

There is no independent episode TTL and no client-side cap on concurrent
sessions, so:

- a rollout run through an Agent's `/run` and abandoned without `verify` or a
  re-seed (trainer crash, client disconnect) leaves its browser open until the
  process exits (local) or the provider reclaims it;
- with a metered provider, size the account quota **above** the rollout
  concurrency, with headroom for sessions still being torn down.

Every acquired provider session is released exactly once — including when the
CDP connect fails after the session was created, and however often `close()` is
called (`tests/test_registry_and_sessions.py`).

A session seeded by an Environment Server carries its episode (`rollout_id`,
`attempt`) to the provider as session metadata, and `remote_cdp` logs the
provider's session id next to it when the session is acquired. That log line is
the join between a provider-side session and the rollout record that held it.

## Run

### 1. Backend contract tests (no GPU, no Gym serving stack)
```bash
uv run --no-project --with playwright python -m playwright install chromium
uv run --no-project --with playwright --with pytest --with pytest-asyncio python -m pytest tests -q
```
Runs one contract against **both** shipped backends: `local_playwright`, and
`remote_cdp` against a Chromium the test suite starts with
`--remote-debugging-port` — so the remote path is covered in CI without any
third-party service. Tasks are the bundled offline `site/` (deterministic, ToS-safe).

> On a bare Linux container/VM, Chromium also needs system libraries (libnss3,
> libgbm1, ...): if the install warns `Host system is missing dependencies to
> run browsers`, run (root/sudo required)
> `uv run --no-project --with playwright python -m playwright install-deps chromium`.

### 2. As a NeMo-Gym environment (rollouts / training)

Requirements for the policy endpoint — it must satisfy **both**:

1. **Speak the Responses API** (`POST /v1/responses`). Gym's own model servers
   already do — `vllm_model` exposes `/v1/responses` and forwards to vLLM's
   chat-completions endpoint for you, so nothing extra is needed there. The
   requirement applies when you point the agent straight at a gateway instead.
2. **Parse tool calls into structured `function_call` items.** If the server
   returns tool-call markup as plain text, the agent sees zero tool calls, the
   browser is never driven, and every rollout "succeeds" with **reward 0.0** —
   silently. For vLLM + Qwen-family models, launch with
   `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes`.

```bash
# from the repo root:
gym env start --resources-server interactive_browser \
  --model-type openai_model --model <served-model-name> \
  --model-url https://your-endpoint/v1 --model-api-key <key> &
gym eval run --no-serve --agent interactive_browser_simple_agent \
  --input resources_servers/interactive_browser/data/example.jsonl \
  --output resources_servers/interactive_browser/data/example_rollouts.jsonl --limit 2
```
Then plug into NeMo-RL GRPO via `examples/nemo_gym/run_grpo_nemo_gym.py`.

A provider's config ships with the provider, so a remote run loads it by path:

```bash
gym env start --config resources_servers/interactive_browser/providers/lexmount/configs/lexmount.yaml \
  --model-type openai_model --model <served-model-name> \
  --model-url https://your-endpoint/v1 --model-api-key <key> &
```

Remote browsers cannot open this repo's offline `site/` pages (local `file://`
URIs), so remote runs use live-web tasks — `data/example_remote.jsonl`, which
that config points at.

## Scope and maturity

This is a working environment meant to be extended, not a finished benchmark.
What that means concretely:

**Dataset.** `data/example.jsonl` is a small set of tasks over the bundled
offline `site/`, and `data/example_remote.jsonl` a handful of live-web ones.
They exist to exercise the loop end to end and keep CI deterministic. Point
`generate_data.py` at your own task source for anything beyond that.

**Verifier.** Outcome-only, checked once in `verify()`: final URL, URL substring,
DOM substring, or an exact answer match. That is enough for tasks with a single
unambiguous end state, and not enough for tasks where the path matters — a
policy that reaches the right URL by a shortcut scores the same as one that
completed the flow. Tasks whose correctness depends on what happened along the
way need a verifier of their own.

**Harness.** The observation is a numbered list of interactive elements plus
capped body text. No screenshots, no accessibility tree, no per-step reward.
A vision policy or a task needing layout will want more than this exposes; the
`BrowserBackend` contract is where to add it.

**Backends.** Local Chromium is the CI path. The hosted provider under
`providers/lexmount/` is one example of a remote backend and is optional — the
environment runs without its SDK installed.
