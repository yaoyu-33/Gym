"""Remote backend: drive a browser that runs somewhere else, over CDP.

The browser may live in another container, on another host, or in a hosted
browser service. This module does not know which — it takes a CDP endpoint from
a `BrowserSessionProvider` and gives it back when the rollout ends. Everything
service-specific (auth, session create/delete, quotas) belongs in a provider.

The built-in `StaticCDPProvider` points at an endpoint that already exists
(`chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222`, a browser container, ...), so this
backend is fully usable — and testable in CI — without any third-party SDK.
