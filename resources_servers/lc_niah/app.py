# Resources server that grades a response on two signals:
#   1. The final answer should match `expected_answer` (answer_score, F1 over a node list).
#   2. The model's reasoning should NOT just copy the input message — we measure the
#      overlap between the reasoning and the prompt (reasoning_overlap).
#
# Three independent overlap signals between the reasoning and the input are
# computed (each in [0, 1], higher = more copying):
#   - seq_match : difflib SequenceMatcher ratio (global similarity)
#   - ngram16   : fraction of the reasoning's 16-grams that appear in the input
#   - lcs       : longest common substring length / reasoning length
#
# Two config knobs decide the reward:
#   - overlap_metric_rule  : which signal becomes `reasoning_overlap`
#                            (seq_match | ngram16 | lcs; default lcs)
#   - overlap_grading_rule : how answer_score and reasoning_overlap combine
#       base     -> reward = answer_score
#       multiply -> reward = answer_score * (1 - reasoning_overlap)  (default)
#       minus    -> reward = answer_score - reasoning_overlap
