"""RoleMRC resources server — role-play machine-reading-comprehension scoring.

Two scoring modes, selected by ``config.mode``:

* ``reference`` — single-turn reference scoring against a gold reply:
  ROUGE / BLEU / METEOR / BERTScore. ROUGE-L is the per-sample reward; the
  other metrics ride along on the verify response. A per-row ``dimension``
  (derived from the RoleMRC ``task`` suffix) lets ``compute_metrics`` break
  results down by RoleMRC's evaluation taxonomy.
* ``judge`` — LLM-as-judge across five aspects (knowledge_range,
  style_compliance, nested_instruction, multi_turn_instruction,
  instruction_priority). Each row triggers one judge call per relevant aspect
  (per its ``task`` field, see ``_EVALUATION_CONFIG``); the per-row reward is
  the mean 0/1 aspect score. Judge calls go to ``config.judge_model_server``.

``compute_metrics`` reproduces every number the RoleMRC report quotes, none of
which is a mean of per-row rewards: ``auto/<metric>/mean`` for the reference
metrics, ``aspect/<aspect>/mean`` for the five judge aspects, and the three
judge roll-ups ``judge/avg_simple`` / ``judge/avg_weighted`` /
``judge/avg_simple_no_mt`` (the headline metric — see :func:`_judge_rollups`).

These roll-ups are only produced when the caller asks for them via
``/aggregate_metrics``. A harness that drives this server through ``/verify``
alone gets per-row rewards and has to aggregate them itself; see
``score_rolemrc_report.py`` for rebuilding the roll-ups from per-row output.

Build the dataset with ``prepare_rolemrc.py`` (downloads ``Junrulu/RoleMRC``).

      headline metric.**

    Caveat on ``avg_weighted``: fitting the aggregates published for 28 model
    runs recovers call counts of (knowledge 601, style 400, nested 159,
    multi-turn 400, priority 84) -- every one within 1 of this dataset's true
    counts except ``instruction_priority``, which is exactly doubled. The raw
    ``roleMRC_test.jsonl`` has 42 rows for the two ``-refused`` tasks that fire
    it (confirmed directly against the file; see ``prepare_rolemrc.py``'s
    ``_EXPECTED_TASK_COUNTS``), so those published runs counted 42 judge calls
    twice. We emit the honest count, which makes our ``avg_weighted`` run
    ~0.7 pp (up to 1.3 pp) above theirs. ``avg_simple`` and ``avg_simple_no_mt``
    are count-independent and therefore identical either way -- including the
    headline metric.
