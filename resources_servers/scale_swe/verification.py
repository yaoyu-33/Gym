"""Run one AweAI-Team/Scale-SWE instance's tests in a sandbox and grade the result.

Scale-SWE is 20,181 rows and entirely Python, so unlike the multi-language sets there is one
test runner (pytest) and one log format. That removes the parser-dispatch problem completely.

Each row carries its own image, an explicit ``workdir``, and a ``pre_commands`` string that
performs the checkout of ``parent_commit`` and scrubs the repo's git history so the fix commit
is not reachable. The failing tests arrive one of two ways -- a literal test file in
``f2p_script`` (92% of rows) or a patch in ``f2p_patch`` (69%) -- and many rows have both.

    """Map each of ``target_ids`` to its pytest status, read from a ``-rA`` short summary.

    A naive ``STATUS <id>`` regex (``\\S+`` up to the first whitespace) is wrong here: this
    dataset parametrizes tests over literal address strings, so a real summary line looks like
    ``PASSED tests/test_parser.py::test_parse_address[No address here-None]`` -- the id itself
    contains spaces. Worse, ``FAILED``/``ERROR`` lines append `` - <reason>``, and some of the
    same ids ALSO contain a literal `` - `` inside their brackets (e.g.
    ``test_parse_address[2590 Elm Road NE - Warren, OH 44483-expected1]``), so no fixed
    delimiter reliably separates "the id" from "the reason" in general.

    Measured cost of getting this wrong: one row in a 200-row sample had 954/954 tests pass,
    with every PASSED line truncated at the first space by the naive parser -- 494 of that
    row's PASS_TO_PASS ids then read as "absent" (not passing), scoring a fully green run as a
    near-total regression.

    The fix sidesteps the ambiguity: rather than parsing an id out of free text, check whether
    the text after the status word STARTS WITH one of the ids we already know we need (the
    row's own FAIL_TO_PASS/PASS_TO_PASS). Real ids always end at a syntactic boundary --
    ``]`` for a parametrized id, an identifier character otherwise -- so a full-string
    ``startswith`` match is exact there; it is only ambiguous for two candidate ids where one
    is a literal prefix of the other (e.g. ``test_foo`` vs. ``test_foo_extra``), which trying
    the longest ids first resolves.
