## Search policy and runtime limits

The server supports regular Gym agents and native MCP clients, including OpenCode
and Pi. See [tool-service behavior and compatibility](../../fern/versions/latest/pages/infrastructure/tavily-search.mdx#tool-service-behavior-and-compatibility)
for the exclusion policy, key pools, bounded retries, and cache limits. These
policies apply to all Tavily configurations, including removal of the aggregate
`Search Answer` section. Tool transcripts and Gym observability record tool use.
