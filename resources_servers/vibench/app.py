"""ViBench resources server (P0).

The rollout copies an artifact out of its own box and this server grades it in a fresh one,
so it never touches the agent's sandbox. Reaching into the agent's box instead would need
serialize()/connect(), which only the OpenSandbox provider implements -- node-local providers
such as Docker cannot support it at all.

  * ``seed_session`` returns the PRD text and asset directory for the task. It creates no
    sandbox and hands out no handle. The agent never sees the test plans.
  * ``responses_api_agents/vibench_agent`` owns the build sandbox, runs a coding harness in
    it, tars the finished app, and writes it to ``artifact_dir``.
  * ``verify`` unpacks that tarball and grades it with ViBench's ``run-seed.py`` then
    ``run-evaluate-post-seeding.py``, once per test plan. Each run stands up the app +
    postgres + code-browse in a *fresh* compose project, seeds it with the seeding agent,
    then scores it with the evaluation agent. (The single-call run-seed-then-evaluate.py is
    not used; see the comment above SEED_SCRIPT.)

``artifact_dir`` is a plain filesystem path shared by the agent and this server. That is not
a new constraint: grading already shells into a local Docker daemon, so both processes are
on one host either way.

The verifier is itself an LLM agent driving a browser, so reward is stochastic -- profile
its variance before using this for training. ``REVERIFY_MODE`` is ``UNSUPPORTED`` because
grading depends on live app and database state.
