"""Generic machine-translation verifier for WMT-style benchmarks.

Two scoring layers:

  * ``verify()`` returns per-sample sentence-chrF and sentence-spBLEU, using
    chrF as the RL reward, plus optional per-rollout language-consistency
    (fraction of the generation detected as the target language). It does
    not call xCOMET. Language-consistency backends run synchronously
    in-process on CPU.
  * ``compute_metrics(tasks)`` groups rollouts by
    ``(source_language, target_language, rollout_index)``, computes
    corpus-chrF and corpus-spBLEU, fills missing per-row xCOMET-XXL scores
    with batched ``predict`` on the extra_gpu actor pool (checkpointing
    ``rollouts.jsonl`` after each wave), and aggregates COMET and
    language-consistency into per-pair + cross-pair means
    (``xx->xx``, ``<src>->xx``, ``xx->{tgt}``) with ``std_dev_across_runs``.
