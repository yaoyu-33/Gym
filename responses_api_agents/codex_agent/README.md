# Codex Agent

Runs the OpenAI Codex CLI (`codex exec`) as a NeMo Gym agent server.

## Native EnvironmentServer sessions

For sandbox tasks, bind `single_agent_turn` to the Codex agent and a Resources server that returns
`SandboxAccess`. Submit episodes to the **EnvironmentServer `/run`** endpoint. Resources creates
and prepares the task sandbox; Codex borrows it, installs the pinned CLI, runs the harness and its
own shell/file tools inside `SandboxAccess.workdir`, confirms process cleanup, and disconnects.
EnvironmentServer verifies only after agent close succeeds, then asks Resources to destroy the sandbox.

Example agent and environment bindings (compose with your Resources, Gym model, and sandbox-provider configs):

```yaml
codex_agent:
  responses_api_agents:
    codex_agent:
      entrypoint: app.py
      num_workers: 1
      model_server:
        type: responses_api_models
        name: policy_model
      codex_version: 0.144.4
      sandbox_mode: danger-full-access
      timeout: 600
      resources_server: null
      openai_api_key: ""

single_agent_turn_environment_server:
  environment_servers:
    single_agent_turn:
      entrypoint: app.py
      resources_server:
        type: resources_servers
        name: task_resources
      agent_server:
        type: responses_api_agents
        name: codex_agent
      default_episode_timeout_seconds: 21600
      cleanup_timeout_seconds: 180
```

The native SWE-bench Pro recipe is `benchmarks/swebench/pro/codex_native.yaml`. Compose it with
sandbox-provider and Gym model configs, materialize the benchmark into task rows, then run collection
with that recipe. It sets `environment_routing_mode: taskset` and maps `swebench_pro:smoke` to
`swebench_pro_codex`. Each input row must contain `task_id: {taskset, task_id}` and
`task_input: {responses_create_params, task_data}`. The collector posts that typed episode to the
EnvironmentServer `/run`; the environment calls Codex's session and `/v1/responses` routes.
The agent's `/run` remains a legacy entrypoint and is not used by this native recipe.

For a one-task native smoke run, first prepare the benchmark's pinned flat JSONL using
`benchmarks/swebench/pro/prepare.py`. In the commands below, `model-provider.yaml` is your deployment
config defining the sandbox provider and `policy_model`, including the served model name and a
sandbox-reachable endpoint. Pass the same configs to both commands: `--no-serve` reuses the running
servers but still loads the collector's routing configuration locally.

```bash
python benchmarks/swebench/pro/materialize_single_agent_tasks.py \
  benchmarks/swebench/data/swebench_pro_benchmark.jsonl /tmp/swebench_pro_native.jsonl

gym env start \
  --config benchmarks/swebench/pro/codex_native.yaml \
  --config model-provider.yaml

gym eval run --no-serve \
  --config benchmarks/swebench/pro/codex_native.yaml \
  --config model-provider.yaml \
  --input /tmp/swebench_pro_native.jsonl \
  --output results/codex_native.jsonl --limit 1
```

Use a sandbox-reachable address for `policy_model`; loopback on the agent host is generally not
reachable from a container. Codex uses the Gym model server's streaming Responses API with the
seeded episode's capture key in its URL. Chat-only backends need Gym's Responses-to-Chat adapter;
pointing Codex directly at a Chat Completions endpoint does not work. This adapter does not strip
reasoning or tool history from Codex model requests. Gym treats Codex's empty `include=[]` as requesting
no additional fields; nonempty Responses-only include requests still require a Responses backend.
Codex also sends `prompt_cache_key`; the inference backend must accept it. Some hosted NIM Chat
endpoints reject this parameter, and no documented Codex configuration omits it. Gym preserves
caller caching controls. A validation-only NIM compatibility bridge that explicitly omits this
optimization does not establish direct NIM compatibility for this adapter.

Native setup requires a direct connection, one agent worker, Linux/glibc on x86_64 or
AArch64 (or musl on x86_64), Bash, and Python 3.8+. The installer checks bootstrap dependencies and installs missing
curl, CA certificates, tar, gzip, coreutils, awk, and flock (util-linux) on root/apt-get or root/apk images; other images must provide
them. It installs Node 22.19.0 and `@openai/codex@0.144.4` under `/tmp/nemo-gym-codex-node-*`, verifies
the CLI version, and reuses that runtime. An interprocess flock serializes cache setup before checking
readiness, so concurrent sessions sharing a sandbox cannot rewrite a running runtime. Session configuration, HOME, and cache files live under
`/tmp/nemo-gym-codex-sessions/*`, outside the task repository. `/`, `/tmp`, and adapter-owned paths
cannot be task working directories. No CLI is required or installed on the agent host for native sessions.
Image architecture support describes the installer contract; validate the actual task image before use.

The runner uses ordinary sandbox `exec`, not the PTY/session API. It enforces its own deadline,
with additional time for descendant cleanup before the provider timeout. Cancellation requests a
stop and waits for the cleanup receipt; uncertain cleanup blocks verification and remains retryable.
Old musl images use a checksum-pinned private C++ runtime for the private Node binary. The task's
Node/Python and global library search path are not replaced.

Each session accepts one activation: a string or one text user message with an optional preceding
system/developer message. Configured `system_prompt`, request `instructions`, and that preceding
message are combined into Codex developer instructions. Existing conversation history and non-text
inputs are rejected before consuming the activation. Native sessions use Codex's own tools; required
HTTP/MCP tool accesses, `extra_config`, `cwd`, and direct-provider URL overrides are unsupported.

Native requests reject `max_output_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, reasoning controls, tool-policy
and other unsupported options. Codex does not expose a reliable output-token/sampling override for
custom Gym providers at the model-request boundary. Set inference limits on the Gym model server
and inspect captured requests to confirm the effective settings. Limits there apply per model call;
`timeout` bounds the whole invocation. Configured `reasoning_effort` is also rejected in native mode.
A supplied request `model` must match the configured agent model. The Resources sandbox supplies
isolation; Codex's inner policy must be `danger-full-access`.

For custom models, set `model_context_window` to the endpoint's actual served context limit.
Codex 0.144.4 otherwise uses a 272,000-token fallback for unknown models, which can delay compaction
until after a smaller endpoint has overflowed. Optionally set `model_auto_compact_token_limit` below
that window to leave room for tool output and the next model response; for a 40,960-token endpoint,
40,960 and 32,768 respectively are a conservative starting point. Both settings must be positive
integers, and an explicit compaction threshold cannot exceed 90% of an explicit context window.
Codex additionally clamps these settings to its model metadata: the unknown-model fallback caps
the context override at 272,000 and compaction at 90% of that cap. Larger values therefore do not
enable a larger context; they need a separately validated model metadata/runtime configuration.
Omitted values preserve CLI defaults. These are harness context-management settings, not per-call
generation limits; configure those on the Gym model server. Compaction remains owned by Codex.

Native responses preserve completed text, reasoning, tool calls/results, and CLI aggregate usage,
including cached-input tokens. Missing `turn.completed`, CLI errors, nonzero exit, and timeouts do
not produce a successful completion. Partial transcripts, including the latest unfinished item updates, are retained in close observations on
cancellation or execution failure. CLI events omit per-model response IDs and often omit reasoning
usage; observations record these gaps explicitly. Usage from a failed turn can be unavailable, so
zero is not evidence of zero model consumption. Compare aggregate usage with captured Gym model calls.
Gym preserves incomplete/failed model status in the Responses SSE terminal event. Codex 0.144.4
treats a model output-limit event as a failed turn after at most five stream reconnects; partial
reasoning survives, while failed-call usage remains available in Gym capture rather than CLI JSONL.
The pinned CLI emits known model-metadata and compaction-accuracy advisories as error items.
On a clean exit ending with `turn.completed` and no other errors, native observations retain their
exact text as warning gaps. Unknown errors and failed or incomplete executions remain unsuccessful.

A Linux child-subreaper supervisor runs once per activation and kills/reaps detached tool descendants.
A successful runner exit alone cannot authorize verification: close requires its cleanup receipt,
runner-handle release, removal of session files, and successful disconnect. Unknown launches and
unconfirmed cleanup fail close and retain session state for retry. Resources always owns sandbox
destruction. The EnvironmentServer supplies the session ID. Repeating an identical seed returns that session;
reusing the ID with changed task, episode, or sandbox access fails. Close also accepts the explicit
ID and episode without a cookie, so a lost seed response can still be cleaned up. Closing an unknown
ID prevents a delayed seed from creating it for the larger of the session lifetime and close retry
window. After a close receipt expires, close returns a conflict while that tombstone remains; it
cannot invent an empty replacement receipt. Caller IDs are never used
as filesystem paths. Sessions expire after `session_lifetime_seconds` (21,600s by default), measured
from completed initialization; expiry uses the same cleanup path and blocks further activation if
cleanup fails. Failed cleanup retains state and logs the need for owner recovery.

Successful close receipts are retained for `session_close_retry_window_seconds` (300s
default); retries do not extend this window. Concurrent close requests share one receipt. Stale cookies
remain invalid after expiry and cannot fall back to host execution. Use a fresh cookie session for a
new episode. State is process-local; permanently failed sessions require owner recovery and worker
recycling. Cleanup is lifecycle coordination, not containment of hostile sandbox code.

`session_close_timeout_seconds` defaults to 60 and `sandbox_install_timeout_seconds` to 600.
Do not increase concurrency without measuring setup time, process/memory overhead, and normal versus
failed close latency on the target image/provider. Native inference support does not establish
training token-ID/logprob support or benchmark accuracy. Runtime/model/provider compatibility and
real model rollout validation must be recorded for each deployment.

## Legacy direct-agent quick start

### env.yaml

For the OpenAI API:

```yaml
openai_api_key: sk-...
```

For any endpoint that serves the OpenAI Responses API over SSE:

```yaml
openai_api_key: EMPTY
```

and set `openai_base_url` (must include `/v1`; Codex appends `/responses` itself).

### Launch

For a quick eval against OpenAI (or any Responses endpoint set via `openai_base_url`), pass the resources server config, which includes the agent server config:

```bash
gym env start --resources-server reasoning_gym/reasoning_gym_codex_agent
```

#### Against a Gym model server

Every Gym model server serves the streaming Responses dialect Codex speaks on `POST /v1/responses` (`SimpleResponsesAPIModel` sanitizes the request and synthesizes the SSE stream), so Codex can run against any backend Gym serves — vLLM, OpenAI, an inference provider. Set the agent's `model_server` ref to that server (it takes precedence over `openai_base_url`); the harness resolves the provider `base_url` to it.

`reasoning_gym_codex_agent_model_server.yaml` wires the agent's `model_server` ref to `policy_model`. Compose it with any model server (here a vLLM serving `policy_model`):

```bash
gym env start \
  --resources-server reasoning_gym/reasoning_gym_codex_agent_model_server \
  --model-type vllm_model
```

This path needs only the model server's `policy_base_url`, `policy_api_key`, and `policy_model_name` (in `env.yaml` or as `+` overrides) — no `openai_*` vars.

### Run the agent

```bash
gym eval run --no-serve \
    --agent reasoning_gym_codex_agent \
    --input resources_servers/reasoning_gym/data/example.jsonl \
    --output codex_rollout.jsonl \
    --limit 1
```

For the model-server config above, use `--agent reasoning_gym_codex_agent_model_server`.

### Smoke test

Check the streaming `/v1/responses` dialect and the real-CLI seam without a full rollout. Launch a model server, then take its URL from the `gym env start` log (`'url': 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>'`):

```bash
gym env start --model-type vllm_model \
  +policy_base_url=https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1 \
  '+policy_api_key=${oc.env:NVIDIA_API_KEY}' +policy_model_name=meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct

# 1. the endpoint speaks the streaming Responses dialect:
curl -N $URL/v1/responses -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"x","stream":true,"input":[{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"2+2?"}]}]}'

# 2. the real Codex CLI runs against it:
mkdir -p /tmp/codex_home && cat > /tmp/codex_home/config.toml <<EOF
model_provider = "gym"
[model_providers.gym]
name = "gym"
base_url = "$URL/v1"
env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
EOF
CODEX_HOME=/tmp/codex_home OPENAI_API_KEY=local \
  codex exec --json --ephemeral --skip-git-repo-check "What is 2+2?" < /dev/null
```

## Description

The agent runs `codex exec --json` as an async subprocess for each request. Codex handles all tool execution (shell commands, file edits, MCP tool calls) internally in a per-rollout scratch working directory. The agent parses the JSONL event stream into NeMoGym output items and forwards the response to a resources server for verification.

Codex talks to the model via the OpenAI Responses API over SSE (`wire_api = "chat"` was removed from Codex). This means it can connect to OpenAI directly, to any endpoint implementing the streaming Responses API, or — via the agent's `model_server` ref — to any NeMo Gym model server, since every Gym model server serves the streaming Responses dialect by sanitizing the request (extra bookkeeping fields, `namespace` tool specs are flattened to plain functions) and re-emitting its complete response as a synthesized SSE stream (see `nemo_gym/responses_streaming.py`).

Each request gets a fresh `CODEX_HOME` with a generated `config.toml` that pins a Gym-owned model provider (no `codex login` needed — the `openai_api_key` config value is handed to the subprocess as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the provider's `env_key`), sets `approval_policy = "never"`, and disables everything that would make a rollout depend on ambient host state or phone home: analytics, update checks, on-disk history, server-side web search, and the multi-agent tool. Session persistence is disabled via `--ephemeral`. The `CODEX_HOME` and scratch working directory are removed after the run, so rollouts cannot contaminate one another.

For legacy callers, Codex is auto-installed lazily on the first local invocation via npm or a local Node.js binary if not already on PATH.

## Configuration

```yaml
codex_agent:
  responses_api_agents:
    codex_agent:
      entrypoint: app.py
      resources_server:
        type: resources_servers
        name: my_verifier
      concurrency: 32
      model: null
      openai_api_key: ${openai_api_key}
      openai_base_url: null
      sandbox_mode: danger-full-access
      timeout: 600
      system_prompt: null
      reasoning_effort: null
      codex_version: 0.144.4
      cwd: null
      stream_idle_timeout_ms: null
      extra_config: {}
```

- `concurrency`: max simultaneous `run()` calls
- `model`: model name written into the generated config. `null` uses the Codex CLI's own default; Gym model servers substitute their configured model anyway, so this mainly matters for direct endpoints
- `openai_api_key`: API key for the endpoint, or any non-empty string for local endpoints
- `openai_base_url`: if set, used as the provider `base_url` (include `/v1`; Codex appends `/responses`). Leave null for the real OpenAI API
- `sandbox_mode`: Codex sandbox policy for model-generated shell commands (`read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`). The default is `danger-full-access` because Gym environments are expected to provide their own isolation (mirroring the Claude Code agent's skip-permissions default); OS-level sandboxing (Landlock/seccomp) is unavailable in many containers
- `timeout`: per-request wall-clock seconds
- `model_context_window`: optional served context window for Codex's context accounting
- `model_auto_compact_token_limit`: optional compaction threshold, at most 90% of an explicit context window
- `system_prompt`: inserted as a `developer` role message via Codex's `developer_instructions` config. The data's system message (if any) is appended after this
- `reasoning_effort`: passed as `model_reasoning_effort` (e.g. `low`, `medium`, `high`)
- `codex_version`: **required** — npm version pinned on auto-install. Every config must pin an explicit version so runs are reproducible and cannot silently drift as new Codex releases land; version bumps become explicit, tested changes
- `cwd`: working root handed to `codex exec --cd`. `null` creates a fresh temp dir per request and removes it afterwards
- `stream_idle_timeout_ms`: provider stream idle budget. Gym model servers emit the synthesized SSE only once the full response is computed, so this must cover an entire generation; `null` defaults it to `timeout * 1000`
- `extra_config`: extra `config.toml` content deep-merged over the generated base config — add MCP servers, feature flags, `model_verbosity`, etc. Per-rollout Gym MCP entries take precedence on name collisions

For the full set of Codex config options see the [Codex configuration reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config).

## Gym MCP tools

When the resources server exposes Gym-owned MCP tools (an `MCPResourcesServer` returning MCP metadata from `/seed_session`), the agent writes a per-rollout `mcp_servers` entry into the generated config.toml: a streamable HTTP server pointing at the resources server's `/mcp` endpoint, with the per-rollout session token carried on a custom header via `http_headers`. Codex advertises these tools to the model as a `namespace` tool spec; the Gym model server flattens them to plain `<namespace>__<tool>` functions on the way in and splits the names back on the way out, so third-party models can call them.

## Skills evaluation

Skills are evaluated as a run-level variable, not a dataset field — point `skills.path` at a directory of [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) skill directories on `gym eval run`, and the agent stages them into each request's `CODEX_HOME/skills/`, where Codex's native skill discovery picks them up:

```bash
gym eval run --agent reasoning_gym_codex_agent \
    --input resources_servers/reasoning_gym/data/example.jsonl \
    --output rollouts_variant_a.jsonl \
    +skills.path=skills/variant_a/
```

Each rollout result is stamped with a `skills_ref` for provenance and grouping during reward profiling, exactly as for the Claude Code agent (see its README for the full workflow).

## Legacy direct-agent limitations

- Eval only for now. Token IDs and logprobs are not wired up yet.
- Token counts come from Codex's own usage reporting (`turn.completed`).
- `turns_used` counts assistant messages right now, not tool calls.
- Codex has no `--max-turns` equivalent; runaway rollouts are bounded by `timeout`.
- Multi-turn dataset inputs are collapsed to a single prompt: only the first `system` message (as `developer_instructions`) and the last `user` message are passed to `codex exec`; any earlier user/assistant/tool turns in `responses_create_params.input` are dropped. This matches the Claude Code agent and is fine for single-turn datasets like reasoning_gym, but datasets that encode prior conversation turns in `input` will not see that history.
