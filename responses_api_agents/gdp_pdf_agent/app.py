GDP.pdf agent — extends simple_agent to embed a pre-rendered document at rollout time.

GDP.pdf rows reference their document by a manifest path (``verifier_metadata.document_manifest``)
rather than inlining anything: the corpus averages ~46 pages per task, so base64 in the JSONL
would make the dataset unusable. The manifest (page text + one 150 DPI PNG screenshot per page) is
produced **once**, at prepare time (``benchmarks/gdp_pdf/prepare.py``'s ``prepare_document()``),
not on every rollout -- GDP.pdf's 100 source PDFs are static, so re-running LiteParse OCR and
page rendering on every row, every repeat, every model (as an earlier version of this agent did)
redundantly repeats the same expensive parse of the same 100 documents. This agent just reads the
cached manifest and resizes the cached page PNGs for its reactive DPI backoff, rather than
re-rendering from the PDF.

DPI/compositing strategy is reactive, not estimated ahead of time: every document starts at
``dpi`` (default 150, matching the manifest's cached resolution). If the policy model rejects a
request (too many images, payload too large, context length exceeded), the agent adapts --
widening page compositing (multiple pages per image, up to 4) if the server reported an explicit
image-count limit, otherwise reducing DPI by 20% toward a ``min_dpi`` floor (default 72) -- and
retries. This mirrors Artificial Analysis's GDP.pdf methodology
(https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology/intelligence-benchmarking#gdp-pdf), which publishes the
DPI endpoints (150, 72) and describes page compositing under tight per-request image-count limits,
not a decrement schedule or a token-budget estimate. A terminal (unrecoverable) input-limit
failure is scored as a zero attempt, matching AA's treatment of failed submissions -- it does not
raise, so the row still gets verified (and scores 0, since an empty answer earns no rubric credit)
rather than being dropped from the run entirely.
