"""In-tree agent-server for wrapping any LangChain `deepagents` graph as a native Gym `responses_api_agents` server.

Generic base for wrapping any LangChain `deepagents` graph as a native Gym `responses_api_agents` server
(model calls go through Gym's own `model_server`, on-policy, instead of the agent bringing its own model).
Concrete instances subclass `DeepAgentsAgent` and implement `build_agent(model)` — see
`reasoning_search_agent.py` for the one used by this repo's reasoning_gym/tavily_search comparison.

See `responses_langchain_bridge.py` for the LangChain <-> Gym Responses API bridge (`GymResponsesChatModel`
and the message-conversion helpers) and why it can't just be `langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI`.

The compiled deepagents graph is built once, in `__init__`, and stored as `self.agent` — not per-request,
and named to match how `deepagents`' own docs/examples name the object `create_deep_agent()` returns
(`agent = create_deep_agent(...)`), rather than `langgraph_agent`'s `self.graph`.
