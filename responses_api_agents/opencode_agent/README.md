# OpenCode Agent

Runs the OpenCode CLI (`opencode run`). OpenCode runs its own tools internally. 
The run's sqlite session is read for the full trajectory (including tool
calls) and converts it into Gym format and uses resources server to verify.

Minimal, meant to be extended, and currently eval-only. 
Token IDs and logprobs are not wired up and
it does not use a Gym model server yet.

## Quick start

OpenCode must be on PATH (auto-installed on first start, or `npm install -g opencode-ai`). Set
`policy_base_url`, `policy_api_key`, and `policy_model_name` in `env.yaml`.

```bash
gym env start \
  --config environments/opencode_math/config.yaml \
  --model-type openai_model

gym eval run --no-serve --agent opencode_math_agent \
  --input environments/opencode_math/data/example.jsonl \
  --output opencode_rollout.jsonl --limit 5
```

Each request gets a temporary directory under `workspace_root`, which the agent deletes after the
run. Leave `repo_dir` unset when no files need to survive, such as a math task. Set `repo_dir` when
OpenCode must edit an environment-owned task directory: the agent creates it if needed, runs
OpenCode there, and preserves it for the environment to grade or collect before cleanup.

```yaml
# Math or another task without persistent files.
repo_dir: null

# AnySWE repository provided by the task sandbox.
repo_dir: /testbed

# Terminal workspace provided by the task sandbox.
repo_dir: /workspace
```

`repo_dir` sets the working directory, not a filesystem boundary. Do not share it across concurrent
requests unless each request runs in an isolated filesystem.

## Model id

`model` is `<provider>/<model-name>`. For a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint, define the provider
in `opencode_config` (written to `opencode.json`) and reference it here:

```yaml
model: nvinf/nvidia/qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct
opencode_config:
  provider:
    nvinf:
      npm: "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible"
      options:
        baseURL: ${policy_base_url}
        apiKey: ${policy_api_key}
      models:
        nvidia/qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct: {}
```

Alternatively, set `model_server` to a Gym model server and set `model` to its served model id. The
agent creates the OpenCode provider entry automatically. Without `model_server`, the existing URL,
key, and provider configuration are unchanged.

## Config fields

- `concurrency`: max simultaneous `run()` calls
- `command`: the OpenCode command, split on spaces so a multi-word launcher works (e.g. `npx opencode`)
- `model`: `<provider>/<model-name>` (see Model id)
- `model_server`: optional Gym model server used to generate the provider entry
- `context_window`: context limit for a generated model entry
- `max_output_tokens`: output limit for a generated model entry
- `openai_api_key`: passed to the subprocess as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `openai_base_url`: passed to the subprocess as `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `env`: extra env vars for the subprocess
- `workspace_root`: where per-request run dirs are created and deleted
- `repo_dir`: optional environment-owned task directory that OpenCode edits and the agent preserves
- `thinking`: passes `--thinking` when true
- `system_prompt`: prepended to the user message
- `setup_timeout`: reserved, currently unused
- `timeout`: seconds for the `opencode run` call
- `extra_args`: extra flags appended to `opencode run`
- `opencode_config`: written to `opencode.json` in `repo_dir` when set, otherwise in the run dir
- `opencode_version`: npm version to pin on install (null means latest)

See `configs/opencode_agent.yaml`.
