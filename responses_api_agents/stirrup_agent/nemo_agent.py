"""NeMoAgent — Stirrup ``Agent`` subclass with Gym-specific behaviour.

1. **tool_response_as_user** — Return a ``UserMessage`` (not ``ToolMessage``)
   from ``run_tool()`` so the conversation history presents tool results
   with ``role=user``.  Reasoning-trained models tend to keep expanding the
   work and emit auxiliary artifacts (charts, methodology notes) when they
   see tool output as a user turn rather than terminating early.

2. **skip_input_file_listing** — Suppresses the file-path listing Stirrup
   injects into the system prompt; useful when a task prompt already lists
   its own reference files (e.g. GDPVal).

3. **safe context compaction** — Removes inline reasoning from generated
   summaries and retries empty or degenerate summaries before replacing the
   live history.

To preserve tool-call metadata that ``Agent.step()`` reads immediately after
``run_tool()`` returns (``.name``, ``.success``, ``.tool_call_id``), the
conversion uses :class:`NeMoUserMessage` — a ``UserMessage`` subclass with
those fields.  Serialisation still renders ``role=user`` so the LLM sees a
user turn.
