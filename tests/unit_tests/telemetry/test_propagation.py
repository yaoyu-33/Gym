"""Cross-process trace propagation — the load-bearing test of this integration.

One rollout crosses several Gym servers, and the whole point of instrumenting Gym is that
those hops end up in **one trace with correct parent/child edges**. Everything else is
supporting work.

Two real FastAPI apps are served over real HTTP on two ports, so `traceparent` genuinely
travels over the wire and is genuinely extracted by the receiver's ASGI instrumentation.
The two apps share this test process (spawning interpreters from a unit test would be
slow and flaky), but nothing about the propagation path is faked: the header is written by
`server_utils.request`, parsed by the FastAPI instrumentor, and the resulting parent link
is what gets asserted.
